        <p class="title"  >Concept</p>
        <span class="text">“A Portrait Through Time” represents the idea that the future is the sum of all perspectives of the individual, from the past to the present, 
            alongside its fragmentation and reconstruction.
            Death and mortality has been a subject for exploration through different areas such as philosophy, art, literature and music. 
            Art has always been a refugee for humans to explain/express the inexplicable, such as death. *Memento Mori* paintings and Vanitas
            both explore the fragility of life and the fleeting moment.

        <p  class="title" >Objectives</p>
        <p class="text" >Through the overlap of different fractions of the face, the system creates a cubist portrait of an individual where different 
            perspectives and moments are detected and displayed in controlled chaos. The three cameras around the spectator, allows for 
            different panoramas of the face to be captured. Using live transmission, the system represents the past and the present, 
            through a camera positioned on the left and another in front of the individual. The third is located on the right side, representing the future.
        </p>

        <p  class="title" >Context</p>
        <p class="text" >“A Portrait Through Time” was developed in the context of the Computational Design Laboratory course of the master's degree in Design and Multimedia
            of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra. 
            We were challenged to explore new ways of developing design artifacts while using computational methods. We had a variety of themes to chose from, 
            and I decided to explore the notion of Future.
